# fcc-nightlife-app

## About

This site was created as part of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)'s back end [projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app).

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [whatsgoinontonight](http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com) and deploy it to Heroku.

Try using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) to find venues in the cities your users search for.
		
### User stories:

- As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
- As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
- As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
- As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

## Detail

I set myself the challenge to complete this project without using any frontend javascript.

It uses nodejs with express, mongoose, passport, jade and ratchet. As I'm using ratchet, I've tried to use a mobile first approach.

This app uses the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview).
